        <p>"Music isn't just a passion; it's my heritage." I'm a seasoned veteran with a decade of experience igniting dance floors from the Bay Area to Reno, Dallas, and Seattle.

Toné!, another uncle who toured with Janet Jackson, and my stepfather, a touring singer, all instilled in me a deep appreciation for diverse sounds and the power of performance.</p>
        <p>My experience runs deep within the nightlife industry. As a former club owner, promoter, and General Manager of The Bluebird Reno for three years, I bring an unparalleled understanding of what makes a night truly unforgettable, from operations to crowd engagement.</p>
